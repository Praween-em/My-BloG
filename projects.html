        <h1>EMOTION AND OBJECT RECIGNITION</h1>
        <p style="margin:30px;" onclick="window.location.href='https://github.com/Praween-em/Face-Recognition-using-Python-and-YOLO'">
            The Emotional Analysis Project utilizes ESP32 CAM technology and emotion recognition algorithms to predict intruders by analyzing facial expressions. Through machine learning, it interprets facial cues to classify emotions, enhancing security monitoring in real-time. This project integrates hardware and software to revolutionize surveillance methods with emotion recognition technology.
